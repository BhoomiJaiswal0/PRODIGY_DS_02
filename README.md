# 🚢 Titanic Survival Data Analysis

This project is part of my data science internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**.  
In this task, I performed **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on the famous **Titanic dataset** to uncover survival trends based on features like gender, age, passenger class, and more.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

---

## 🎯 Goals of the Analysis
- Inspect and understand the structure of the dataset  
- Handle missing values and perform feature engineering  
- Explore and visualize patterns in survival rates  
- Analyze the impact of variables like **Sex**, **Pclass**, **AgeGroup**, **Title**, and **FamilySize** on survival  

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Females had higher survival rates** than males across most classes.
- **Children and first-class passengers** had better chances of survival.
- **Family size** had a U-shaped relation with survival chances.
- Passengers with titles like "Mrs", "Miss", and "Master" had different survival outcomes based on social class.
